# Solana Staking (Anchor)

Tiny Anchor program showing a minimal staking ledger (for demo/portfolio).

## Files
- `programs/solana-staking-anchor/src/lib.rs` – program with `initialize`, `stake`, `unstake`.

## Notes
This is a simplified example for code review, not production. In a real protocol
you’d wire SPL token accounts, vaults, emissions, and full constraints/tests.
